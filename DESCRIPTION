Authors@R: 
    person("James", "Edwards", , "jamese1326@gmail.com", role = c("aut", "cre"))
Description: Confidence intervals for the mean of a response variable grouped by a 
    predictor variable. The response can be numeric with confidence intervals calculated 
    using Gaussian assumptions, or if the response has two classes, then a binomial
    confidence interval can be used.
